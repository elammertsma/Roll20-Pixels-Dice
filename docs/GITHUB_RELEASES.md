## For Developers: Creating Releases

### Automated Process
When you're ready to release a new version:

1. **Update version in `manifest.json`:**
   ```json
   "version": "2.1.0"
   ```

2. **Build the extension:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Create a release package:**
   - Zip the `dist/` folder
   - Name it: `pixels-dice-roll20-v2.1.0.zip`

4. **Create GitHub Release:**
   - Go to Releases → Draft new release
   - Tag: `v2.1.0`
   - Title: `Pixels Dice for Roll20 v2.1.0`
   - Description: Include changelog and features
   - Upload the ZIP file
   - Publish

### Version Numbering
Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- `2.0.0` → Major (breaking changes)
- `2.1.0` → Minor (new features, backward compatible)
- `2.1.5` → Patch (bug fixes)

```
